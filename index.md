
This is the unified ICAS ontology designed to describe the
abstraction of information-security related information as used
by performers on the DARPA ICAS project.

## A Brief Explanation of OWL and RDF

The unified ICAS ontology is a collection of
[OWL2](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) ontologies under the
`http://www.invincea.com/ontologies/icas/1.0/` namespace. Each
ontology covers a specific conceptual area; for instance all
information related to users and user accounts is captured in the
User ontology.

OWL2 is an ontology description language built on top of the
[Resource Description Framework (RDF)](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/).
RDF describes a way of storing data that is different from the
traditional table-based conception. RDF data consists of triples,
and only triples; each triple, called a *statement* consists of a
*subject*, *predicate*, and an *object*.

The *subject* represents a resource of some kind, the *predicate*
a relation, and the *object* can either be a literal value or
another resource.

OWL2 and the [RDF Schema (RDFS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/)
define a set of resources and properties that can be used to
develop ontologies for RDF datasets.

### Examples

This section contains some annotated excerpts from the ontologies
as examples of how to read RDF and OWL. These examples are
encoded in the [Terse RDF Triple Langauge (Turtle)] (http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/),
just like the ICAS ontology. This is intended only as an
overview and omits many details

##### Turtle Primer

Recall that RDF consists only of *statements*, each of which is
composed of a *subject*, a *predicate*, and an *object*. In
the Turtle encoding, there is a shorthand creating multiple
statements that uses the `;` to indicate continuation with the
same *subject*. The following example shows how to interpret this
syntax.

``` turtle
<subject> <predicate> <object> ;
            <predicate> <object> .

<subject-2> <predicate-2> <object-2> .
```

##### UserAccount Class

This example depicts the UserAccount class from the User
ontology. It contains five statements in the Turtle syntax,
all of which share  `:UserAccount` as the subject.

``` turtle
:UserAccount a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:comment "an individual set of credentials."@en ;
    rdfs:label "User"@en ;
    rdfs:subClassOf owl:Thing .
```

The first statement `:UserAccount a owl:Class` states that
`:UserAccount` has the type `owl:Class`. `owl:Class` is used to
define types of resources.

The next two statements provide labels and comments - essentially
annotations - a about `:UserAccount`. The third statement is
standard and simply indicates that a `:UserAccount` is something
that exists in the world

##### Datatype Property

Datatype Properties describe the types of literal information
that can be represented and connected to resources. The following
excerpt describes the `:hasFullName` property, which represents
the concept of a user's display name.

``` turtle
:hasFullName
    a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:comment "and extended name or description, used only for display purposes"@en ;
    rdfs:label "has full name"@en ;
    rdfs:domain :UserAccount ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string .
```

The first statement is similar to what we saw before, but this
time it indicates that `:hasFullName` is a DatatypeProperty.  The
comment and label fulfill the same role as in the prior example.

The last two statements `:hasFullName rdfs:domain :UserAccount`
and `:hasFullName rdfs:range xsd:string` represent constraints on
this property. The former states that only `:UserAccounts` may be
the *subject* of this property. The latter says that the literal
object value of this property must be of type string.


##### Object Property

Object Properties describe relationships between resources.
The example below captures the notion of group membership for users
in computing systems. Note the use of `rdfs:domain` and
`rdfs:range` to constrain the valid *subject* and *objects* for
this *predicate*.

``` turtle
:memberOfGroup
    a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :UserAccount ;
    rdfs:label "is member of Group"@en ;
    rdfs:range :Group ;
```

## File Structure

Each of these sub-ontologies is written to a separate file that
shares the same name as the ontology using the
[Terse RDF Triple Langauge (Turtle)] (http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/)
encoding.  Thus, the User ontology can
be found in user.ttl and the Authentication ontology can be found
in authentication.ttl.

Although each file focuses on a specific set of concepts, they
are not isolated. At the top of each file, a series of namespaces
describe other ontologies from which that sub-ontology uses concepts.


## Tools for Reading OWL2 Ontology Files

While OWL2 ontology files are human readable, the Semantic Web
community has also developed a wide variety of GUI based tools
that can be used to read and edit ontology files. Links to a
selection of these tools can be found on the [Semantic Web
Wiki](http://semanticweb.org/wiki/Category:Ontology_editor)
